# geochem

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

! Developement of this package has just begun !


The goal of geochem is to analyse and wrangle geochemical data sets more efficiently with the help of R. Most geochemical datasets contain elements as variables and only a few categorical variable. Geochems aim is it to make looking at those different elements in a more consistend workflow. 

## Installation

Package is not on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) yet.

You can install the released version of geochem from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("geochem")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("muhohl/geochem")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(geochem)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

### Laser Maps

TODO Write instructions for the laser maps function!

1. Load the files / Create a random laser map data frame

```{r}

```

2. Select the elements
```{r}

```

3. Create a Log_Trans tibble
```{r}

```

4. Use the clipping function 
```{r}

```

5. Clip the data set
```{r}

```

6. Create list with plots
```{r}

```

7. Plot the list with plots
```{r}

```

8. Save the plot 
```{r}

```

### XMOD Maps

A couple of functions that allow the user to plot XMOD maps.

# TODO 
    
    * Add remaining functions. 
    * Create dummy data frames for laser spot data, a laser map, and a XMOD data set.
